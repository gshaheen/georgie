A little project to learn how to build a command line interface. I used the Alchemy API (https://www.alchemy.com/) to create a command line interface to queary/watch the ethereum blockchain.

This CLI allows you to:
- Configure the CLI with your Alchemy API key
- Choose your ethereum network (mainnet, goerli, etc)
- Get the balance of an ethereum address
- Get the current gas price
- Watch transactions for a specific address, or if you don't specific the address, you get to watch the latest blocks generate in near-real-time

Cheers
